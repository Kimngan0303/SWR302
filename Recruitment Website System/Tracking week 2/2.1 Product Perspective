The Job Recruitment Website is a new, standalone web-based platform developed to streamline the recruitment process by connecting job seekers with employers. It is not a continuation or upgrade of a previous system, nor is it part of a larger suite of recruitment tools. Rather, it is an entirely new product aimed at addressing the inefficiencies of traditional hiring methods.
The system is designed with a modular architecture, which allows for future integration with external services such as:
Payment gateways (e.g., VNPay, Momo),


Third-party job aggregators (e.g., Indeed, VietnamWorks),


Chatbot/AI recommendation engines,


Email  notification systems.


In future releases, it may be extended with a mobile app component but currently functions as an independent web application.
A context diagram will be provided to illustrate the interaction between the system and its users (job seekers, employers, admins) as well as any external services.
